## Overview
Focused implementation of high-impact conversion improvements to drive signups without adding social authentication complexity.

---

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Visual Email Preview Section (NEW)
**Location**: Between "Features" and "Privacy" sections

**What it does**:
- Shows visitors exactly what they'll receive every week
- Displays a realistic, interactive email preview in a mock email client
- Includes actual training plan format with:
  - Weekly summary (mileage, run days, recovery status)
  - Day-by-day workout breakdown
  - Pace guidance and coaching tips
  - Personalized coach's note

**Why it works**:
- **Reduces uncertainty**: Visitors see the actual product before signing up
- **Tangible value**: Makes the abstract concept of "AI training plans" concrete
- **Visual proof**: Shows professional, thoughtful design = credibility
- **Example workouts**: Demonstrates different run types (easy, tempo, long runs)

**Conversion psychology**:
- "Show, don't tell" - most powerful form of social proof
- Reduces perceived risk by revealing exactly what you get
- Creates desire through visualization

   - Sets expectation for future premium features

2. **"Which running watches work?"**
   - Lists Garmin and Strava coverage

   - Shows plans scale to all levels
   - Mentions injury prevention for beginners

8. **"Is my data secure?"**
   - Security and privacy concerns
   - Bank-level encryption mention

**Why it works**:
- **Pre-emptive objection handling**: Answers questions before they become reasons to leave

- **Trust building**: Transparency about limitations and processes
- **Conversion recovery**: Catches visitors in the "consideration" phase before bouncing
